Download the firmware to your computer and  follow the instructions on this video to update your ONO-SENDAI to the 1.3F version.

To resume: pressbootsel, keep it pressed, press reset, release reset, release bootsel. A window will appear with the pico memory. Drop the firmware file inside that window and it´s done

1.3F is still a bit glitchy (using start/stop key does crash) but it has a lot of new tricks and the coarse pot is playable. It´s oriented to the hacky tribe. A more stable version with the corrected bug and more features will appear soon
