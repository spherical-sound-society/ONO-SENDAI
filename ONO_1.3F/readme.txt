Download the firmware to your computer and  follow the instructions on this video to update your ONO-SENDAI to the 1.3F version.

To resume: pressbootsel, keep it pressed, press reset, release reset, release bootsel. A window will appear with the pico memory. Drop the firmware file inside that window and it´s done
